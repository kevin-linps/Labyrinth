Labyrinth is a game where the player navigates in a dungeon-themed maze with a flashlight in hand. Press WASD keys to move physically and use mouse to change view direction. (ESC to exit the game!)

Now. Let's have fun!


## Building the project

This project uses CMake so that it is IDE-independent. Ideally this project is also platform-independent, but so far it has only been tested with Visual Studio 2019 on Windows. Linux and Mac testings are on the way.


## Features to be added
* Allow player to run the game on secondary monitor.
* Add mini-map on side of the screen to aid navigation.
* Set an objective for this game (e.g. shortest time).
* It would also be cool to create night vision effect.
